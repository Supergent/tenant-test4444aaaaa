## 🎯 Before You Start

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and fill in:
# - CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT (from npx convex dev)
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL (from npx convex dev)
# - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start Development
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Convex
npx convex dev

# Terminal 2: Start Next.js
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Test the App
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Sign up with email/password
- [ ] Create a task
- [ ] Change task status
- [ ] Delete a task
- [ ] Open in two tabs, verify real-time sync
- [ ] Check task statistics update

## 🔍 Architecture Validation

### Verify Four-Layer Architecture
- ✅ `ctx.db` only used in `convex/db/*.ts`
- ✅ Endpoints compose db operations (no direct `ctx.db`)
- ✅ Helpers have no database access
- ✅ All operations scoped to authenticated user

### Verify Authentication
- ✅ Every endpoint checks `authComponent.getAuthUser(ctx)`
- ✅ Ownership verification before modifications
- ✅ Proper error messages for unauthorized access

### Verify Rate Limiting
- ✅ All mutations are rate-limited
- ✅ Sensible limits per operation type
- ✅ Uses `user._id` as rate limit key

### Verify Type Safety
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ Convex validators on all endpoints
- ✅ Type exports from database layer
- ✅ Proper error handling

## 📊 Current Features

### Working Features
- ✅ User authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out)
- ✅ Create tasks with title, description, priority
- ✅ Update task status (pending → in progress → completed)
- ✅ Delete tasks
- ✅ Real-time synchronization
- ✅ Task statistics (total, by status, completion rate)
- ✅ Overdue task detection
- ✅ Rate limiting on all mutations
- ✅ Loading states and skeletons
- ✅ Empty states
- ✅ Responsive design

### Defined But Needs UI
- ⏳ Task comments
- ⏳ Activity timeline
- ⏳ User preferences (theme, view, sorting)
- ⏳ Task tags
- ⏳ Due date picker
- ⏳ Drag-and-drop reordering
- ⏳ AI assistant chat

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **AI Integration** - Placeholder implementation, needs real API integration
2. **Theme Switcher** - UI not implemented (endpoint exists)
3. **Task Tags** - Schema supports it, but no UI yet
4. **Drag and Drop** - Endpoint exists, but UI not implemented
5. **Comments** - Full API exists, but no UI

## 📚 Quick Reference

### Important Files
- `convex/schema.ts` - Database schema (from Phase 1)
- `convex/endpoints/tasks.ts` - Main task API
- `apps/web/components/task-dashboard.tsx` - Main UI
- `packages/components/src/providers.tsx` - App providers
- `.env.local` - Environment configuration

### Common Commands
```bash
# Start everything
